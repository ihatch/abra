# Abra: a living text

Abra is an interactive and generative poetry app for iOS, developed by Ian Hatcher. The original Abra text was written by Amaranth Borsuk and Kate Durbin. The three of us collaboratively conceptualized and designed the app, which was released in 2015 in conjunction with a clothbound artist's book. Abra was supported by an Expanded Artistsâ€™ Books grant from the Center for Book and Paper Arts, Columbia College Chicago, and the National Endowment for the Arts.
