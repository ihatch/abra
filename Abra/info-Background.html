        <h1>Background</h1>

        <p>The recipient of an Expanded Artists’ Books Grant from the Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, Abra is an exploration and celebration of the potentials of the book in the 21st century.</p>
        
        <p>A collaboration between poets Amaranth Borsuk and Kate Durbin, artist-developer Ian Hatcher, and a potentially infinite number of readers, the project has two main manifestations: a limited-edition artist’s book and an interactive app that can be read separately or together, with the iPad inserted into a slot in the back of the book.</p>
        
        <p>Abra plays with the notion of the “illuminated” manuscript in both physical and digital forms. In the artist’s book, readers are invited to touch the surface of the page, interacting with thermochromic ink, laser-cut openings, and letterpress impression. Cut-outs in the pages gradually reveal the undulant text on the screen below in which the poems themselves are in flux, coalescing and dispersing in an ecstatic helix of language.</p>
        
        <p>In this app, the book’s poems grow and mutate, blurring the boundary between text and illumination, marginalia and body. With a single touch, readers can join in the collaboration, mutating the text further to create new juxtapositions. Abra functions much like the magic word of its origin—ABRACADABRA—as an unpredictable living text.</p>
